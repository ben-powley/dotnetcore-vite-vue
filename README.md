# Dotnet Core | Vite | Vue

A starter template for running a dotnet core server, a Vue 3 front-end and compiling it with Vite.

Currently, it's a bit janky to get up and running. To get it running, you need to -

- Run `npm install`
- Run `cd ClientApp`
- Run `npx vite`
- Run the dotnet core app from the CLI or Visual Studio
